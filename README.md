# blackjack
## Overview
This project was undertaken during my Python Scripting course in Spring 2024 as an individual, accelerated track. My goal was to create a multiplayer blackjack game with a graphical user interface (GUI). Although the development was halted after the course, the experience taught me valuable lessons in writing organized, thoughtful code and maintaining meaningful documentation.
## Key Features
- Multiplayer Support: Designed for multiple players to engage in a fun and competitive game of blackjack.
- Graphical User Interface: A user-friendly GUI to enhance the gaming experience.
- Documentation: Well-structured and meaningful documentation to assist future development and understanding of the code.
## Learning Outcomes
Through this project, I:
- Improved my proficiency in Python programming.
- Developed problem-solving skills by addressing new challenges during the development process.
- Gained experience in writing organized and maintainable code.
## Future plans
The project is currently unfinished as its development was halted after the conclusion of the course. I do not currently plan to continue it.
